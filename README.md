# Redbox Inventory System

## Project Overview
The Redbox Inventory System is a Java-based application designed to manage DVD inventory for Redbox kiosks across the US. The system processes transactions from rental kiosks, updates inventory records, and generates reports on DVD titles and their availability. The system utilizes a custom-built binary search tree to efficiently manage inventory data.

## Key Features

- **Report Generation**: Generate in-order and pre-order reports displaying DVD title availability and rental status.
